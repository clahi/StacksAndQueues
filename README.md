# Stacks
A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the
last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. A user may insert objects into a stack at any
time, but may only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains
(at the so-called “top” of the stack).

# Queues
Another fundamental data structure is the queue. It is a close “cousin” of the stack,
as a queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the
first-in, first-out (FIFO) principle. That is, elements can be inserted at any time,
but only the element that has been in the queue the longest can be next removed.
